For the interpretation:
1. Begin with the primary hexagram's overall meaning and how it relates to the querent's situation
2. Examine each changing line specifically - these are the active, dynamic points of the reading
3. If there is a transformed hexagram, explain how the situation is evolving from the primary state to this new state
4. The changing lines bridge the two hexagrams - they show the process of transformation

Remember: Changing lines (old yang ⚊○ and old yin ⚋×) are where the energy is most active. They indicate where change is happening or needs to happen.`,

The first hexagram (with its changing lines and transformation) represents the past - the energies and patterns that have shaped the current moment.

The second hexagram (with its changing lines and transformation) represents the future - the energies and patterns that are emerging.

Consider:
1. What story does the past hexagram tell about how the querent arrived at this moment?
2. What is the future hexagram suggesting about the path ahead?
3. How do these two readings relate to each other? Is there continuity, contrast, or evolution?
4. Pay special attention to any trigrams that appear in both readings - they may indicate persistent themes.`,

Each hexagram represents a different facet or question:
1. The first hexagram: The situation as it currently stands
2. The second hexagram: The challenge or obstacle
3. The third hexagram: The guidance or way forward

Analyze each hexagram with its changing lines and transformations, then synthesize how they work together to illuminate the querent's path.`,
